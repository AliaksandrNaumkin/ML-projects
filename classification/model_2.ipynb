    "Overall, the model seems to perform reasonably well. However, it's important to note that there is room for improvement, especially in terms of specificity, which is relatively lower compared to other metrics. Depending on the specific business requirements and the cost associated with misclassifications, the model could be further fine-tuned or another algorithm could be explored to achieve a better balance between precision and sensitivity."
